    Here is a job description:

    Here is the current resume:
    {resume_text}

    Here is a resume template for you to use:
    {resume_template}

    ##################################################

    Based on the job description, modify the resume to best suit the role by tailoring relevant skills, experiences, and phrasing. Ensure that the final content adheres to the following requirements:

    - Provide the modified resume **exclusively in LaTeX code format**, ready for compilation using `xelatex`.
    - Include only English text. Avoid non-English content.
    - Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or additional notes.
    - Ensure the output is fully formatted, as if it were the final version intended for submission.
    - Preserve any existing links from the original resume; do not invent or omit links.
    - Avoid LaTeX syntax issues such as misplaced alignment tabs (`&`) and ensure there are no errors such 
    as "Missing begin document.
    - Aim to fit the resume onto a single page, following the provided template.
    - Make sure it fits XeTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-0.999996 (TeX Live 2024) (preloaded format=xelatex).
    - Do not include signs that will cause problem compiling the latex code such as &.
    - Do not remove any important information in the resume (such as a work place, education, or skill).
    - The Resume template provided is only a template, do not use any information from it other than the 
    template it is written in - all information needs to come from the current resume.
    - Do not leave out links that don't exist - such as "Your github" etc, if they don't exist in the 
    current resume, don't include anything related to them in your response.
    - DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER SIGNS OR CHARACTERS RATHER THAN THE LYCH CODE.

    If these conditions cannot be met, do not attempt to fix them; simply write the number "69" to indicate an error. Otherwise, produce a valid, polished resume.
